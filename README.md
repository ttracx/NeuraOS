## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before setting up NeuraOS, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

- **Linux Distribution:** Preferably Ubuntu or similar Debian-based distributions.
  
- **Kernel Headers:** Must match your current kernel version.
  
- **Python 3.8+**
  
- **Git:** For version control.
  
- **Internet Connection:** Required for installing dependencies and accessing OpenAI's API.

### Setup Scripts

NeuraOS provides a set of bash scripts to automate the setup process. These scripts handle project creation, dependency installation, kernel module compilation, installation, user-space service setup, and cleanup.

#### 1. `create_project.sh`

**Description:**  
Creates the NeuraOS project structure and populates essential files with their respective contents.

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/create_project.sh
```

2. `install_dependencies.sh`

**Description:**  
Installs necessary system and Python dependencies required for NeuraOS.

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/install_dependencies.sh
```

3. `compile_kernel_module.sh`

**Description:**  
Compiles the NeuraOS kernel module.

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/compile_kernel_module.sh
```

4. `install_kernel_module.sh`

**Description:**  
Inserts the compiled NeuraOS kernel module into the running kernel.

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/install_kernel_module.sh
```

5. `run_user_space.sh`

**Description:**  
Starts the NeuraOS user-space services, including the command handler daemon.

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/clean_project.sh
```

### Configuration

#### OpenAI API Key

NeuraOS utilizes OpenAI’s GPT-4 for natural language processing. To configure NeuraOS, you need to provide your OpenAI API key.

1. **Obtain an API Key:**
   - Sign up or log in to OpenAI.
   - Navigate to the API section and generate a new API key.
2. **Configure the API Key:**
   - Open the `llm_service.py` file located in the `user_space/` directory.

```bash
nano user_space/llm_service.py
```

   - Replace the placeholder `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.

```python
openai.api_key = 'sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

   - **Security Tip:**
     Avoid hardcoding API keys in scripts. Consider using environment variables or secure storage solutions.

## Usage

### Running User-Space Services

To start NeuraOS user-space services, execute the `run_user_space.sh` script. This script initiates the command handler daemon, which listens for commands from the kernel module and executes them accordingly.

```bash
./scripts/run_user_space.sh
```

**Expected Output:**

```
NeuraOS: Starting user-space services...
NeuraOS: Starting command_handler.py as a background process...
NeuraOS: Command handler started with PID: 12345
NeuraOS: Logs can be found at NeuraOS/user_space/command_handler.log
NeuraOS: User-space services are running.
```

### Sending Commands

NeuraOS allows users to send natural language commands through the `llm_service.py` script. The script interprets these commands using GPT-4 and communicates them to the kernel module for execution.

**Example Command:**

```bash
python3 user_space/llm_service.py "Open Firefox browser."
```

**Expected Output:**

```
NeuraOS: Sent command to kernel: open_application:firefox
```

**Result:**

The Firefox browser should launch automatically.

### Example Commands

- **Open an Application:**

```bash
python3 user_space/llm_service.py "Launch the text editor."
```

- **Shutdown the System:**

```bash
python3 user_space/llm_service.py "Please shut down the system."
```

- **Restart the System:**

```bash
python3 user_space/llm_service.py "Restart my computer."
```

- **Check System Status:**

```bash
python3 user_space/llm_service.py "How is my system performing?"
```

*Note: Implement appropriate command handling for system status queries.*

## Security Considerations

NeuraOS integrates AI capabilities directly into the operating system, necessitating stringent security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Permission Verification:**
  The kernel module verifies user permissions before executing sensitive commands (e.g., shutdown, restart). Only authorized users (e.g., root) can perform such actions.
- **Secure Communication:**
  Ensure that only trusted user-space services can communicate with the kernel module. Implement additional authentication mechanisms if necessary.

### Input Validation

- **Sanitization:**
  All incoming commands are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks or malicious exploitation.
- **Command Whitelisting:**
  Restrict the set of executable commands to a predefined list to minimize risk.

### Data Privacy

- **API Key Protection:**
  Securely store and manage the OpenAI API key to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Data Handling:**
  Limit the amount of user data processed and ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Audit Trails:**
  Maintain logs of all executed commands and access attempts for auditing purposes.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:**
  Implement monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.

### Resource Management

- **Dedicated Resources:**
  Allocate dedicated CPU and memory resources for the LLM service to avoid contention with other system processes.
- **Cgroups and CPU Affinity:**
  Use cgroups to limit the resources available to user-space services and set CPU affinity to bind processes to specific CPU cores.

### Caching Mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Kernel Module Fails to Load:**
   - **Symptoms:**
     Errors during `insmod` execution, missing kernel symbols.
   - **Solutions:**
     - Ensure kernel headers match your current kernel version.
     - Check for syntax errors in `ai_os_module.c`.
     - Verify that the Netlink protocol number (`NETLINK_USER`) is not conflicting with existing protocols.
2. **User-Space Services Not Receiving Commands:**
   - **Symptoms:**
     Commands sent via `llm_service.py` are not executed.
   - **Solutions:**
     - Confirm that the kernel module is loaded (`lsmod | grep ai_os_module`).
     - Check logs using `dmesg | tail` for any errors.
     - Ensure that `command_handler.py` is running without errors.
3. **Applications Fail to Launch:**
   - **Symptoms:**
     Commands like “Open Firefox” do not launch the application.
   - **Solutions:**
     - Verify that the application name is correctly specified.
     - Ensure that `command_handler.py` has the necessary permissions to launch applications.
     - Check the `command_handler.log` for any error messages.
4. **System Shutdown/Restart Commands Not Executing:**
   - **Symptoms:**
     Commands to shut down or restart the system are ignored or result in errors.
   - **Solutions:**
     - Ensure that the user executing the command has root privileges.
     - Verify that permission checks in the kernel module are correctly implemented.
     - Check `dmesg | tail` for any permission-related warnings.

### Log Files

- **Kernel Logs:**
  Use `dmesg` to view kernel module logs.

```bash
dmesg | tail
```

- **User-Space Logs:**
  Check `command_handler.log` located in the `user_space/` directory.

```bash
cat user_space/command_handler.log
```

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Kernel Module Status:**

```bash
lsmod | grep ai_os_module
dmesg | tail
```

2. **Check User-Space Services:**
   Ensure that `command_handler.py` is running.

```bash
ps aux | grep command_handler.py
```

3. **Test Communication:**
   Send a simple command and verify if it’s received and executed.

```bash
python3 user_space/llm_service.py "Open Terminal."
```

4. **Review Permissions:**
   Confirm that the executing user has the necessary permissions to perform system-level operations.
